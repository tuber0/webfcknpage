<ul> 
  <li>chorus 1: <br> 
   <br> I push my fingers into my eyes...
    <br>It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...
   <br> But it's made of all the things I have to take...
   <br> Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...
   <br> If the pain goes on... <br>
</li>
<br>
<li>verse 1: <br> 
   <br> I have screamed until my veins collapsed
   <br> I've waited as my time's elapsed
   <br> Now, all I do is live with so much fate
  <br>  I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
 <br>   I've left behind this little fact:
  <br>  You cannot kill what you did not create
  <br>  I've gotta say what I've gotta say
  <br>  And then I swear I'll go away
   <br> But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
  <br>  I guess I'll save the best for last
  <br>  My future seems like one big past
  <br>  You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice
</li>
<br>
<li>chorus: <br>
   <br> I push my fingers into my eyes
   <br> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
<br>If the pain goes on,
  <br>  I'm not gonna make it! <br>
</li> 
  <br>

  <li>
verse 2: <br>
<br> Put me back together
<br>Or separate the skin from bone
<br>Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
<br>Tell me the reality is better than the dream
<br>But I found out the hard way,
<br>Nothing is what it seems!

  </li>

  <li>
chorus: <br>
<br>I push my fingers into my eyes
<br>It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
<br>But it's made of all the things I have to take
<br>Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
<br>If the pain goes on,
<br>I'm not gonna make it!
<br>

<br>All I've got...all I've got is insane...
<br>All I've got...all I've got is insane...
<br>All I've got...all I've got is insane!
<br>All I've got...all I've got is insane!
<br>
<br>I push my fingers into my eyes
<br>It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
<br>But it's made of all the things I have to take
<br>Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
<br>If the pain goes on,
<br>I'm not gonna make it!
